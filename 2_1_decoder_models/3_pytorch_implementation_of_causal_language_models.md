### Study Notes: Decoder Models - PyTorch Implementation of Causal Language Models

#### **Introduction**

- The video focuses on **Decoder Models** and their **PyTorch Implementation** for **Causal Language Models (CLMs)**.
- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Understand how to create a decoder model for **next token prediction** using **PyTorch**.
  - Learn to **collate functions** and apply a **causal mask** to prevent access to future tokens.
  - Explore the **Custom GPT architecture** used in decoder models.

#### **Decoder Models Overview**

- **Definition**: Leverage only the **decoder** part of a transformer model.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - The **attention layers** in a decoder can only access tokens preceding a given token.
  - Typically referred to as **autoregressive models**.
- **Pre-training Process**:
  - Trains on predicting the next word in a sentence.
  - Primarily used in **text generation** tasks.

#### **Key Features of Decoder Models**

1. **Autoregressive Behavior**:
   - At each stage, only prior tokens in the sequence can be used for prediction.
2. **Similarity to GPT Models**:
   - Decoder models are akin to **Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)** models.
3. **Applications**:
   - Effective in generating coherent and contextually relevant text.

#### **Steps to Build a Decoder Model**

1. **Dataset Preparation**:

   - Use the **IMDB dataset** with test and validation splits for training and evaluation.
   - Each data record contains:
     - A **sentiment label** (often ignored in this task).
     - A **textual element** used to create training data.

2. **Tokenization and Vocabulary**:

   - A **customized vocabulary** is necessary to tokenize and map textual data into indices.
   - Special tokens in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
     - **Unknown token (UNK)**: Represents words outside the vocabulary.
     - **Padding token (PAD)**: Ensures sequence lengths are equal across a batch.
     - **End-of-Sentence token (EOS)**: Marks the end of a sequence.

3. **Creating Training Data**:
   - **Steps**:
     - Load the IMDB dataset.
     - Use a custom vocabulary to tokenize text and map it into indices.
   - Context size and random selection in sequences help generate source and target data for training.

#### **Causal Masking**

- **Purpose**:
  - Prevent the model from accessing future tokens during training.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use the function **`generate_square_subsequent_mask`** in PyTorch:
    - Creates a **diagonal matrix**.
    - Ensures tokens are only influenced by their preceding tokens.
  - Result:
    - Generates an **upper triangular matrix** filled with **negative infinities** for restricted positions.

#### **Custom GPT Architecture**

- **Components**:
  1. **Embedding Layer**:
     - Maps input tokens to dense vectors of size **`embed_size`**.
  2. **Positional Encoding Layer**:
     - Adds **positional information** to input embeddings.
  3. **Transformer Encoder**:
     - Consists of **multi-head self-attention layers**.
     - Incorporates a **source mask** to restrict future token visibility.
     - Allows the encoder to function as a decoder.
  4. **Linear Layer (`lm_head`)**:
     - Outputs **logits** over the vocabulary size for language modeling.

#### **Training the Custom GPT Model**

- **Forward Method**:
  - Takes an input sequence of tokens (`x`).
  - Adds **positional encoding**.
  - Applies **source mask** and **padding mask**.
  - Outputs a sequence of **contextual embeddings**, converted to **logits**.

#### **Key Functions**

1. **Collate Function**:

   - Collects and aligns data from different functions to form cohesive batches.
   - Ensures sequences in a batch are padded and equal in size.

2. **`generate_square_subsequent_mask`**:
   - Used to create causal masks.
   - Ensures model predictions depend only on prior tokens.

#### **Process Visualization**

1. **Context Size Specification**:
   - Defines the **block size** and input text.
2. **Random Sampling**:
   - Randomly selects points in the text sequence to generate source and target sequences.
   - The **target sequence** is created by shifting the source sequence by one token.
3. **Source and Target Verification**:
   - Ensure both sequences are of equal size (e.g., 10 tokens long).

#### **Summary**

- **What You Learned**:
  - How to create a decoder model using **PyTorch**.
  - How to collate functions and use a **causal mask**.
  - How the **Custom GPT architecture** enables next-token prediction.
- **Steps Recapped**:
  - Specifying **context size** and sampling points in text.
  - Collating sequences into a batch with equal size.
  - Implementing causal masks to restrict future token visibility.
  - Using the **Custom GPT architecture** to predict logits over the vocabulary.

By understanding these concepts, you can now effectively build and implement decoder models for causal language modeling.
