### Study Notes: Decoder Models in PyTorch

#### Introduction to Decoder Models
- **Decoder Models**: Neural network architectures used in sequence-to-sequence tasks such as:
  - **Machine Translation**
  - **Image Captioning**
- **Core Functionality**:
  - Use encoded information to generate output sequences.
  - Operate similarly to **Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT)**.

1. Create small instances of decoder models.
2. Calculate the loss for these models.
3. Understand the training process for decoder models.
4. Generate text autoregressively.

### Key Concepts in PyTorch Decoder Models

#### Small Instance Creation
1. **Define Model Hyperparameters**:
   - Example: Encoder layers = 2, Attention heads = 2.
2. **Model Initialization**:
   - Define an instance of the custom GPT model.

#### Loss Calculation
- **Process Overview**:
  1. The encoder generates a source and target sequence.
  2. Target batch dimensions = Sequence length × Batch size.
  3. Decoder generates logits during prediction.
- **Logit Dimensions**:
  - Sequence length × Batch size × Number of classes.
- **Reshaping for Loss Calculation**:
  - Logits and target tensors are reshaped to ensure alignment for loss estimation.
  - Each logit row corresponds to token predictions across sequence and batch dimensions.

#### Training Process
- **Training Workflow**:
  - The process is comparable to training **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, **Transformers**, and other generative models.
- **Key Components**:
  - Modified loss shape.
  - Validation and checkpoint-saving functions.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Use the evaluate function to compute the average loss on the validation dataset.

### Autoregressive Text Generation (Inference)
- **Definition**:
  - Method of text generation where the model predicts the next token in a sequence based on previous tokens.
  - Iterative process: Token generated one at a time, fed as input for the next prediction.
- **Encoding Prompt**:
  - Serves as the starting point for text generation.
  - Tokenized and mapped to vocab indices with padding for multi-batch processing.

#### Steps for Generating Autoregressive Text
1. **Encoded Prompt Creation**:
   - Convert the input sentence into an encoded tensor.
2. **Model Execution**:
   - Feed the encoded prompt into the decoder model.
   - Generate logits and select the highest logit score to identify the next token.
3. **Token Generation**:
   - Append the predicted token to the prompt.
   - Continue looping until:
     - Sentence completion.
     - Maximum new tokens reached.
4. **Masking**:
   - Model generates a mask to process inputs and outputs logits for predictions.

#### Practical Example
- A decoded prompt tokenized into vocab indices and padding.
- Use the **generate function** to:
  - Create the encoded prompt tensor.
  - Execute the model to output logits and identify the highest scoring token.
  - Append the token to the prompt for subsequent predictions.
