### Study Notes: Transformers for Classification Encoder

#### Overview
This video explains how **transformer-based models** are utilized for **text classification**. Key takeaways include:
- Creating the text processing pipeline.
- Building, training, and testing the transformer model.
- Understanding the role of **attention layers** in retaining contextual relationships.

### Key Concepts

#### Why Transformers for Text Classification?
- Traditional neural networks lose **contextual relationships** between words in documents.
- Transformers, with their **attention mechanisms**, process the entire sequence collectively, retaining contextual information.

### Steps to Build a Transformer Model for Text Classification

#### 1. Dataset Preparation
- **Dataset Used**: AG_NEWS dataset (contains news articles and their categories).
- **Steps**:
  1. Create iterators for training and testing splits using **torchtext**.
  2. Assign labels to the text categories (e.g., "business" or "science and technology").
  3. Split training data into:
     - **95% for training**
     - **5% for validation**
  4. **Tokenizer**: Tokenizes English text, generates tokens, and constructs a vocabulary.
  5. **Custom Collate Function**: Handles sequence classification and applies **zero padding** to standardize sequence lengths.

#### 2. Model Construction
- **Embedding Layer**:
  - Created using `nn.Embedding` in PyTorch.
  - Maps vocabulary tokens to dense vectors (`embedding_dim`).

- **Positional Encoding**:
  - Adds temporal context by embedding sequence order into word embeddings.
  - Ensures the model captures both **semantic** and **positional** information.

- **Transformer Encoder**:
  - Consists of multiple layers using `nn.TransformerEncoderLayer`.
  - Configurations include:
    - **Number of layers (num_layers)**
    - **Number of attention heads (n_heads)**

- **Linear Classifier**:
  - A `nn.Linear` layer serves as the classifier.
  - Input size: Embedding dimension.
  - Output size: Number of classes (categories).

- **Forward Method**:
  - **Input tensor (x)**:
    - Represents sequence tokens.
    - Passed through the embedding layer and scaled by the square root of the model dimension.
  - **Embedding Process**:
    - Example: Sentence "I like football" tokenized and indexed as `[0, 317, 341]`.
    - Converted to high-dimensional embeddings.
    - Positional encodings added.
  - **Transformer Encoder**:
    - Applies attention mechanisms to capture contextual information.
    - Generates **contextual embeddings** of the same dimensions as input embeddings.
  - **Dimensional Reduction**:
    - Averages embeddings along dimension 0 to create a single embedding per sequence.
    - Example: 64 sequences with 100-dimensional embeddings are reduced to 64 instances, each with 100 features.
  - **Prediction**:
    - Aggregated embeddings passed to the linear classifier to predict text categories.

#### 3. Model Training
- **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy Loss for multi-class classification.
- **Optimizer**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with:
  - Learning rate: `0.1`
  - Step scheduler: Reduces learning rate by a factor of `0.1` after each epoch.
- **Training Process**:
  - Track metrics such as **cumulative loss** and **accuracy per epoch**.
  - Validation accuracy increases as training loss decreases.
- **Output**:
  - The model predicts **64 label outputs** (one per sample in the batch).

### Key Highlights of the Transformer Model
1. **Retains Context**:
   - Unlike traditional models, transformers utilize attention layers to process sequences collectively, ensuring context is preserved.
2. **Efficient Encoding**:
   - Embeddings and positional encodings combined to represent both meaning and order.
3. **Generalization**:
   - Performance on **larger datasets** is typically better than traditional neural networks.

### Summary of the Pipeline
1. **Data Pipeline**:
   - Create iterators, allocate datasets, tokenize text, and build vocabulary.
   - Design custom functions for padding and data loading.
2. **Model Building**:
   - Create embedding and positional encoding layers.
   - Use transformer encoder layers to process embeddings.
   - Employ a linear classifier to predict labels.
3. **Training**:
   - Apply standard classification procedures.
   - Track metrics and optimize the model using SGD and a step scheduler.
4. **Output**:
   - Model predicts text categories with improved accuracy due to context-aware processing.
