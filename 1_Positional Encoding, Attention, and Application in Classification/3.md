### Study Notes: Self-Attention Mechanism

#### **Introduction**
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**:
  - Central to language transformers.
  - Enables each word in a sequence to attend to every other word in parallel, generating embeddings.
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Describe **simple language modeling**.
  - Explain **sequence and context embedding** in self-attention mechanisms.
  - Understand how self-attention predicts tokens.

---

#### **Simple Language Modeling in Self-Attention Mechanism**
- Predicts the next word in a sentence, aiding in natural language understanding.
- Example: 
  - Input: "not like" → Prediction: "hate".
  - Input: "do like" → Prediction: "like".
- **Contextual Meaning**:
  - Changes in context alter the meaning of preceding words.

---

#### **Matrix Representation in Self-Attention**
- Words are transformed into **matrices**:
  - Each embedded word is represented as a **column vector** in a sequence matrix.
  - Example: Matrix \( X_{\text{not like}} \) contains embeddings for "not" and "like".
- Sequence matrices represent **n sample sequences**:
  - Each sequence can vary in length.
  - Libraries like **PyTorch** may organize vectors differently.

---

#### **Core Components of Self-Attention**
- **Query (Q)**, **Key (K)**, and **Value (V)** are generated:
  - Derived from input word embeddings and learnable parameters.
- **Derivation Process**:
  - Query Matrix: Input sequence × **Query projection weights** + Bias.
  - Key Matrix: Input sequence × **Key projection weights** + Bias.
  - Value Matrix: Input sequence × **Value projection weights** + Bias.
  - Sequential embeddings may be added beforehand for better representation.
- **Purpose**:
  - Refines input embeddings to produce **contextual embeddings (H')**.
  - Contextual embeddings are enhanced representations of input embeddings.

---

#### **Steps in Self-Attention Mechanism**
1. Multiply Query and Key matrices → Compute **attention scores**.
2. Normalize scores with the **Softmax function**.
3. Multiply normalized scores with the Value matrix to produce \( H' \):
   - \( H' \): Enhanced contextual embeddings.
4. Further refinement:
   - Apply another layer to \( H' \), producing \( H \), a more nuanced embedding.

---

#### **Context Embedding to Neural Networks**
- Contextual embeddings serve as inputs to a neural network:
  - Initial layer output: \( Z^1 \).
  - Final layer output: \( Z^2 \), representing logits.
- **Softmax** is used during training to compute probability distributions for predicted words.

---

#### **Training and Prediction**
- Example: Predicting the token for "not like":
  - Generates Q, K, V matrices via matrix multiplications with learnable parameters.
  - Scores normalized using Softmax.
  - Multiply normalized scores with Value matrix → Refined embeddings (\( H' \)).
  - Use Argmax to extract the predicted word token, e.g., "hate".
- Operates efficiently on GPUs, allowing parallel processing of large data volumes.

---

#### **Advantages of Self-Attention**
- Outperforms sequential models like RNNs by processing all words in parallel.
- Provides better context understanding through **attention scores**:
  - Highlights relational dynamics between tokens in a sequence.
  - Example: "not like" and "not hate" relationships.

---

#### **Key Features of Self-Attention Mechanism**
- **Attention Scores**:
  - Derived by computing the dot product of Query and Key matrices.
  - Normalized to focus on important parts of the sequence.
- **Contextual Embeddings**:
  - Enhanced by multiplying normalized scores with Value matrix.
  - Provides refined embeddings used for predictions.

---

#### **Applications in Translation**
- Self-attention is used to translate embedded words:
  - Dot product between embedding and list of embeddings identifies relationships.
  - Final predictions are determined by Argmax on logits.

---

#### **Summary of Key Concepts**
1. **Simple Language Modeling**:
   - Predicts next word using context.
   - Words are transformed into **matrices** of embeddings.
2. **Query, Key, Value**:
   - Derived from input word embeddings and refine input data.
3. **Self-Attention Outputs**:
   - Generates contextual embeddings (\( H' \)) and refined embeddings (\( H \)).
4. **Mechanics**:
   - Uses normalized attention scores, matrix multiplications, and neural networks for prediction.
5. **Advantages**:
   - Efficient processing (parallelized on GPUs).
   - Improved context understanding and language modeling.

---

#### **Conclusion**
- Self-attention mechanisms are essential for natural language understanding and token prediction.
- Their ability to attend to all tokens simultaneously makes them powerful tools for sequence modeling tasks like language translation.
